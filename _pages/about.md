<u><b>About Me</b></u>: I study the guidance and fine-tuning of diffusion models. I have previously interned with the Seed Foundation Team at <a href='https://team.doubao.com/en/topseed'>TikTok / ByteDance</a>, the Center for Artificial Intelligence at <a href='https://www.bosch-ai.com'>Bosch</a>, and the Center for Computational Mathematics at the <a href='https://www.simonsfoundation.org/flatiron/center-for-computational-mathematics/'>Flatiron Institute</a>. I have published both <i>theoretical</i> and <i>applied</i> work on diffusion models.

<u>Theoretical</u>
<ul>
<li>ICML 2023 Workshop: Non-normal diffusion processes and connecting EMA training of diffusion models to two-body Hookean systems.</li>
<li><b>ICLR 2024 Spotlight</b>: Retaining likelihood estimation capabilities in multi-stage diffusion models (in collaboration with Meta AI).</li>
</ul>

<u>Applied</u>
<ul>
<li>NeurIPS 2024: Guided diffusion modeling through the lens of optimal control (in collaboration with Bosch AI)
<li>NeurIPS 2024: Model alignment and unlearning in diffusion models.</li>
<li>In Submission: Fast and efficient guided diffusion modeling for image reconstruction in the presence of measurement noise.</li>
<li><b>In Submission</b>: Large-scale diffusion models for simultaneous text and image generation (in collaboration with Seed Team at TikTok / ByteDance).</li>
